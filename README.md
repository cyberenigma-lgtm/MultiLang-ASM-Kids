**The fun, colorful, and easy way to learn computer magic!**

MultiLang-ASM Kids is the educational branch of the [MultiLang-ASM](https://github.com/cyberenigma-lgtm/MultiLang-ASM) project. It is designed to teach children (ages 5-18) the basics of low-level programming without the scary technical terms.

## 🚀 Why Assembly for Kids?
Learning how computers essentially "think" builds strong logical foundations. We allow kids to write code in their native language using simple verbs.

- **Instead of:** `mov rax, 10`
- **We say (English):** `put box 10`
- **We say (Spanish):** `pon caja 10`

## 🌍 Supported Languages
We support **27 languages** specifically optimized for children's vocabulary, including:
- English, Spanish, French, German, Italian
- Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Arabic
- Hindi, Turkish, Polish, Swedish, Dutch... and more!
